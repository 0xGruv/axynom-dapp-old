# Axynom DApp (Old Version)

This repo contains an early attempt to build the Axynom DApp.

It was part of the exploration phase — mostly HTML, JS, and Web3 experiments. Not used anymore, but kept public as part of the journey.

If you're looking for the real work, check out the latest:

Nothing in here is polished. It’s here because every protocol starts somewhere.
